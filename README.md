Attempting to use blockchain as a basis for PKI

"blockchain-master" folder contains all the prior work down on this project. The team needs to read through this to better understand what work needs to be done.

The white papers containing the preliminary research on the different components of the project are saved to the N57 shared drive.

The team is currently led by ENS Schumacher. LTJG Dibart, LTJG Blaze, CTN1 Fonseca, CTN3 Sessoms, CTN3 Brown,  and CTN3 Kelley are the other current active team members.
